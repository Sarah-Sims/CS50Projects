Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 1000000 simulations seemed to give weird results.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I'd call it good enough at 10000.
